!2 Change Browser Executable Directories
The default executable paths for '''Chrome''' and '''Firefox''' can updated by following these steps:

 1 Open ${automated.testing.home}/configs/custom.properties in a text editor.
 1 Update '''chrome.browser.home''' to point to the chrome executable.
 1 Update '''firefox.browser.home''' to point to the firefox executable.
 
'''Note:''' If on Windows make sure to escape backslashes, e.g. C:\\FitNesseForAppian rather than C:\FitNesseForAppian
