!2 Change ''!-FitNesseForAppian-!'' Wiki Directory
The default root directory (the location used for loading FitNesse wikis) is ${automated.testing.home}.  This can be updated by following these steps:

 1 Open ${automated.testing.home}/fitnesse.properties in a text editor.
 1 Update !-FitNesseRootDir-! to refer to the repository containing the !-FitNesseRoot-! folder.  This folder contains the contents of the test scripts within !-FitNesse-!.
 1 Update !-FitNesseRoot-! to refer to the folder name containing the wikis.

 1 Next time you use ${automated.testing.home}\start.bat the wikis will be pulled directly from the repo folders.

'''Note:''' If on Windows make sure to escape backslashes, e.g. C:\\FitNesseForAppian rather than C:\FitNesseForAppian

Add something about needing to leave a space (or just fix this!)
