!2 Change ''!-FitNesse-! for Appian'' Home Directory
The default installation directory of '''${automated.testing.home}''' can updated by following these steps:

 1 Open TESTING_HOME/configs/custom.properties in a text editor.
 1 Update '''automated.testing.home''' to refer to the correct TESTING_HOME directory, e.g. automated.testing.home=C:\\AutomatedTesting.
 
'''Note:''' If on Windows make sure to escape backslashes, e.g. C:\\FitNesseForAppian rather than C:\FitNesseForAppian
