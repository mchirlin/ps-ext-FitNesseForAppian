!1 Testing in FitNesse
There are two main ways to run a test:
 * [[As an individual test case.][#testpage]]
 * [[As a suite of test cases that will automatically run all tests.][#suitepage]]
 
!anchor testpage
!2 Running a Test Page
Selecting '''Test''' within a test page runs that individual test, including all of the content in the page. Basic results regarding the number of verification successes and failures, and the final result are listed at the top.

The test will launch a new browser window that performs the testing script. The original Test Page will now show the lines of the script that have been executed. A summary of the test execution results are displayed at the top of the Test Page:

!2 Running a Suite Page
Selecting '''Suite''' on a Suite page runs all tests consecutively and returns the final result of each individual test page. This allows the tester to automatically run all tests in a collection. Click [[here for more information on Test Suites][.FitNesse.FullReferenceGuide.UserGuide.WritingAcceptanceTests.TestSuites]].

!2 Testing Results
Upon completion, each line of a test script will indicate successful completion or errors using highlighting colors. These can vary depending onthe type of method used in the script.
Possible result statuses include:
 * [[No color][#nocolor]]
 * [[Yellow][#yellow]]
 * [[Green][#green]]
 * [[Red][#red]]
 
!anchor nocolor
'''No color'''

No color indicates success for methods that perform no verification, such as '''Click''' or '''Populate'''.

!anchor yellow
'''Yellow'''
!img -w 900 http://files/images/FitNesse-Test-Result-Yellow.png

Yellow indicates that an exception has been thrown, usually for syntax errors in the script or due to technical problems. This can apply to any type of method. 

!anchor green
'''Green'''
!img -w 900 http://files/images/FitNesse-Test-Result-Green.png

!anchor red
'''Red'''
!img -w 900 http://files/images/FitNesse-Test-Result-Red.png
