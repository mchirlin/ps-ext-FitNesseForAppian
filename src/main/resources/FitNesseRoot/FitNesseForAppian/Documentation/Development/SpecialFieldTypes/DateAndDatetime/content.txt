!3 Date and Date Time Fields 
Date and Date Time should be formatted in your test scripts as 
 * YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm
  * 24 Hour Clock means there is no need for AM or PM
 * YYYY-MM-DD 

Additionally, if you declare '''|set start time|''' in your setup configuration, then you are able to create dates by using + Number of Time units (minutes, hours, days, months, or years).  For example, use '''+5 days''' to input a date 5 days from today.   

Note: Date Time fields are considered one field when inputting into FitNesse
