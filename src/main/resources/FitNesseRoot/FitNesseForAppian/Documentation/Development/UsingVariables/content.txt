!3 Why are there so many ways to set variables in !-FitNesse-! for Appian?!
I can set variables in the following ways:

![:
!define VAR_NAME {VAR_VALUE}
|$VAR_NAME=        | method that returns VAR_VALUE |
|set test variable | VAR_NAME | with | VAR_VALUE |
]!
What are the differences? Why are there so many?!

!anchor generatingData
!3 How can I create random data for my tests

Regex (Field, News, Record, Task, etc...)
Get field values (field, section, grid)
get random (string, int, decimal, date)
call web api (mockaroo)

!3 Creating Unique Test Data
The ''!-FitNesse-! for Appian'' tool has various ways to create unique random data to ensure uniqueness of your test.  Random variable generations includes:
 * Strings - contains letters and number that are based on a user defined length 
 * Integers - contains an integer number between a user defined min and max
 * Decimals - contains a decimal number between a user defined min and max with a user defined number of decimal places
