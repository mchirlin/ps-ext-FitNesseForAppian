!2 Fixing Errors in your Test Scripts
!3 Spacing
!-FitNesse-! tests can be fragile due to issues with spacing in test scripts.  Tips for dealing with spacing issues: 
 * One space after vertical line | is usually OK, but 2 spaces may break your script
 * Avoid spaces at the beginning of a line before any |
 * In test scripts, after blank lines you need to include a '''|script|''' to continue your script. In scenarios, blank lines will end your scenario
 * Use the Format button after writing your test script to automatically format your test script or select the Auto Format checkbox to format your test script every time you save

!3 !-PascalCase-! in Test Script 
!-FitNesse-! recognizes the use of PascalCase as a Wiki Word. Notice the question mark (?) following the word !-PascalCase-!. This indicates that FitNesse is attempting to link to another wiki page.
To create a test script with a field or input that requires the use of a !-PascalCase-! word, escape the table by placing an exclamation mark at the beginning, e.g. '''!|script|'''  instead of '''|script|'''.

!3 Add wait times for Fragile tests 
For tests that may be fragile or take longer than others, add '''| wait for | X seconds |''' before the test step and report this to Forum.  Fragile test steps can include:
 * Uploading large files
 * Dynamic SAIL components
 * Long database queries
