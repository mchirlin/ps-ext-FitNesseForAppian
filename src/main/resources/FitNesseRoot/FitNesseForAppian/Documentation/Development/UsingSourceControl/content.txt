!2 Using Version Control with ''!-FitNesse-! for Appian'' Test Scripts

Use of a version control system in conjunction with the ''!-FitNesse-! for Appian'' is highly recommended. 

The benefits of version controlling your test scripts include, but are not limited to:
 * Easy collaboration between testers and developers
 * Tracked history of changes in the scripts
 * Backup of test scripts
 * Accessibility across environments

!3 Follow these steps to Version Control your !-FitNesse-! tests:
 1 Create a new repository ('''REPO_HOME''') for your project. This can version controlled with !-GitHub-!, !-BitBucket-!, SVN, or any other version control software.
 1 Inside '''REPO_HOME''' create a folder named '''!-FitNesseRoot-!''' to contain your wikis.
 1 Also inside '''REPO_HOME''' create a folder named '''Documents''' to contain any documents uploaded in your wikis.
 1 Follow [[these instructions][.FitNesseForAppian.Documentation.Administration.ChangeFitnesseForAppianWikiDirectory]] to run !-FitNesse-! with your version controlled wikis rather than the out-of-the-box wikis.
 1 Copy the contents from '''FITNESSE_FOR_APPIAN_HOME/!-FitNesseRoot-!''' into your '''REPO_HOME/!-FitNesseRoot-!''' folder. This will allow you to access the documentation for both !-FitNesse-! and !-FitNesse-! for Appian.
 1 Update your repository to ignore all changes to the !-RecentChanges-! folder as this will cause merge conflicts in the future.
 
!3 How to keep your test OS and user agnostic

 * Never hard code a path to your local machine, instead use the following variables:
  * !-${FITNESSE_ROOTPATH}-! - the location from where !-FitNesse-! loads the wikis. For this variable to work, you must have a value populated for FitNesseRoot in ${automated.testing.home}/fitnesse.properties.
  * !-${automated.testing.home}-! - the location where !-FitNesse-! is installed

!4 Handling user logins

 * Use generic roles or user names for logging in, don't use your own username.
 * In order to run a test on their locale machine, all users will need to have all usernames or roles used in any test defined in their local FITNESSE_FOR_APPIAN_HOME/configs/users.properties file.

If you have the following in your test:

|login with username|test.user|
Any person running that test will need the following line in their FITNESSE_FOR_APPIAN_HOME/configs/users.properties file:
test.user=TEST_USER_PASSWORD

Or, if you have the following line in your test:

|login with role|basic_user|
Anyone running the test will need to have the following line in their FITNESSE_FOR_APPIAN_HOME/configs/users.properties file:
basic_user=test.user|TEST_USER_PASSWORD


!4 Handling file population
 * When populating files always using forward slashes (/) as they work for Max, Linux, and Windows
 * When populating files always place the files in the '''REPO_HOME/Documents''' folder and use !-${FITNESSE_ROOTPATH}-! instead of typing out an absolute path to the file. For this variable to work, you must have a value populated for FitNesseRoot in ${automated.testing.home}/fitnesse.properties.
 
Example:
|populate field|FILE_UPLOAD_FIELD_LABEL|with|!-${FITNESSE_ROOTPATH}-!/Documents/example.txt|
