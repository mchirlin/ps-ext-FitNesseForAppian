When logging into Appian using a username and password use one of the following methods:

'''Recommended methods'''
|login with username           |USERNAME                      |
|login with terms with username|USERNAME                      |

|login with terms with role    |USER_ROLE                     |
'''Deprecated methods'''
|login with username           |USERNAME|and password|PASSWORD|
|login with terms with username|USERNAME|and password|PASSWORD|

Each of these methods will take the following actions:
 * Navigates browser to URL defined by: | set appian url | APPIAN_URL |
 * Logs into Appian

The recommended methods replace the deprecated methods which also required a password in-line. This has the advantage of masking the password in test scripts and version control system.

Passwords can be defined in two ways, using usernames or using role aliases. To create a username or a role edit '''${automated.testing.home}/configs/users.properties'''

'''Using a username'''
Add a new line with: USERNAME=PASSWORD

'''Using a role alias'''
