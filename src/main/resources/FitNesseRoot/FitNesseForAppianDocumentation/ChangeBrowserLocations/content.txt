!2 Change Browser Executable Directories
The default executable directories for '''Chrome''' and '''Firefox''' can updated by following these steps:

 1 Open ${automated.testing.home}\configs\custom.properties in a text editor.
 1 Update !-chrome.browser.home-! to refer to the path to the chrome executable
 1 Update !-firefox.browser.home-! to refer to the path to the firefox executable
 
'''Note:''' Make sure to escape backslashes, e.g. C:\\Program Files(x86)\\ rather than C:\Program Files(x86)
