!2 Fixing Errors in your Test Scripts
!3 Spacing
!-FitNesse-! tests can be fragile due to issues with spacing in test scripts.  Tips for dealing with spacing issues: 
 * One space after vertical line | is usually OK, but 2 spaces may break your script
 * Avoid spaces at the beginning of a line before any |
 * In test scripts, after blank lines you need to include a '''|script|''' to continue your script. In scenarios, blank lines will end your scenario
 * Use the Format button after writing your test script to automatically format your test script or select the Auto Format checkbox to format your test script every time you save

!3 camelCase in Test Script 
!-FitNesse-! recognizes the use of camelCase as a Wiki Word. For more information about Wiki Words, please see the FItNesse Documentation.

To create a test script with a field or input that requires the use of a wiki word, use '''!|script|'''  instead of '''|script|''' at the beginning of your test script.

!3 Creating Unique Test Data
The ''!-FitNesse-! for Appian'' tool has various ways to create unique random data to ensure uniqueness of your test.  Random variable generations includes:
 * Strings - contains letters and number that are based on a user defined length 
 * Integers - contains an integer number between a user defined min and max
 * Decimals - contains a decimal number between a user defined min and max with a user defined number of decimal places 

!3 Add wait times for Fragile tests 
For tests that may be fragile or take longer than others, add '''| wait for | X seconds |''' before the test step and report this to Forum.  Fragile test steps can include:
 * Uploading large files
 * Dynamic SAIL components
 * Long database queries

!3 !-FitNesse-! Log
