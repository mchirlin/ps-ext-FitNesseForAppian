!2 Change Appian FitNesse Root Directory
The default root directory for Appian FitNesse is ${automated.testing.home}.  This can be updated by following these steps:
 1 Open TESTING_HOME\fitnesse.properties in a text editor.
 2 Update !-FitNesseRootDir-! to refer to the repository containing the !-FitNesseRoot-! folder.  This folder contains the contents of the test scripts within !-FitNesse-!.
 3 Update !-FitNesseRoot-! to refer to the folder name containing the wikis.

 4 Next time you use TESTING_HOME\start.bat the wikis will be pulled directly from the repo folders.
