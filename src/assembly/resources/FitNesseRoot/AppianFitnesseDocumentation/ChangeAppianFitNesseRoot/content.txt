!2 Change Appian FitNesse Root Directory
The default root directory for Appian FitNesse is ${automated.testing.home}.  This can be updated by following these steps:
 1 Open ${automated.testing.home}\fitnesse.properties in a text editor.
 1 Update !-FitNesseRootDir-! to refer to the repository containing the !-FitNesseRoot-! folder.  This folder contains the contents of the test scripts within !-FitNesse-!.
 1 Update !-FitNesseRoot-! to refer to the folder name containing the wikis.
