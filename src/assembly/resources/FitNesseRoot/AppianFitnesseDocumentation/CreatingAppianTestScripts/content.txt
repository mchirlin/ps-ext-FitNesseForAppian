!1 Creating Appian FitNesse Pages 
New pages can be created by using the header and clicking on Add.  You can add 3 types of pages:
 * Test Pages
 * Suite Pages
 * Static Pages
!2 Test Page
Test pages consist of a test script that can be executed by the tool on the 

The first line of your test script will almost always be '''|script|'''.  '''|script|''' will denote to FitNesse that the following rows are all steps in the test script.

Use the [[Appian Fitnesse Cheat Sheet][.AppianFitnesseCheatSheet]] to locate the appropriate method you need to use.  Implement each interaction with Appian by using a specific method that you can find in the [[Appian Fitnesse Cheat Sheet][.AppianFitnesseCheatSheet]].

Note: FitNesse wiki language is case sensitive. Methods  are always lower case, and inputs to the methods must match what is displayed on the Appian interface.  
!3 Date and Date Time Fields 
Date and Date Time should be formatted in your test scripts as 
 * YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm
  * 24 Hour Clock means there is no need for AM or PM
 * YYYY-MM-DD 

Additionally, if you declare '''|set start time|''' in your setup configuration, then you are able to create dates by using + Number of Time units.  For example, use '''+5 days''' to input a date 5 days from today.   

Note: Date Time fields are considered one field when inputting into FitNesse

!3 File Upload
When populating a file upload field, the location of the file is required (e.g. ${automated.testing.home}\documents\low risk.jpg).  There is no need to click on the â€œChoose Fileâ€� button.

!3 [Indexing]
Indexing is useful for interacting with fields without a label or when multiple fields have the same label.  Indexes start at 1 and can be called like [1].  Indexing can make a test script more fragile when updating the interface. 

!2 Suite Pages
A suite is a collection of test pages and static pages that are related to each other.  Test pages within a suite will contain any !-SetUp, TearDown and ScenarioLibrary-! pages created within the suite.

!2 Static Pages 
A static page is a content page. Static pages can be used to give additional information and context around a suite.  

!3 Certain Static Pages are keywords for FitNesse 

 * '''!-SetUp-!'''
  * A !-SetUp-! page is a static page used to define the actions that will happen at the beginning of every test script run within a suite
  * Typical methods included in a setup are listed in the Setup Configuration section

 * '''!-TearDown-!'''
  * A !-TearDown-! is a static page that defines the actions that happen at the end of every test scriptrun within a suite
  * Typical methods used a !-Teardown-! include
   * '''| logout |''' - logs out of the appian instance
   * '''| tear down selenium web driver |''' - Closes the browser 
 * '''!-ScenarioLibrary-!'''
  * A !-ScenarioLibrary-! is a static page that contains all the available scenarios for a suite
  * Scenarios are reusable methods that are created specifically by using Appian FitNesse methods to perform actions used multiple times in a test page or suite
  * ADD LINK TO CREATING SCENARIOS
!2 Executing Your Test or Suite
When a Suite or Test page is displayed, the FitNesse header will say Suite or Test, respectively.  When in a Suite, clicking Suite will run all test pages that exist in the suite.  Within a test page, only the test page will run.
!2 Test Script Validation Types
Colors of Highlighted Fields on Results Page:
 * Red means that there was a failure of the test (e.g. element was recognized but not populated).
 * Yellow means that there was an error with the code (e.g. code is missing a |script| line, the field was not found on the page, or a system error).
 * Green means that this line ran correctly.

Test does not start: If the error below appears, simply click on Test/Suite again.
