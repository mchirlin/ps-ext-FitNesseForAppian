!2 Using Version Control with Appian FitNesse Test Scripts

Use of a version control system in conjunction with the Appian FitNesse is highly recommended. The repository directory '''(${automated.testing.home}\FitNesseRoot)''' contains all test scripts and should be version controlled using your preferred version control mechanism, such as [[Git][http://www.git-scm.com/]].

The benefits of version controlling your test scripts include, but are not limited to:
 * Easy collaboration between testers and developers
 * Tracked history of changes in the scripts
 * Backup of test scripts
 * Accessibility across environments
